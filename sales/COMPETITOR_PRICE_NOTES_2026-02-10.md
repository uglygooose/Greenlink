## Notes
- The above typically covers tee sheet / bookings features. **Accounting automation** (balanced VAT journals, Pastel layout matching, automated desktop import) is often a separate implementation or custom integration.
- GreenLink pricing is quoted in ZAR and includes locally-tailored finance automation and HNA compliance workflows (as scoped in the pilot quote).
