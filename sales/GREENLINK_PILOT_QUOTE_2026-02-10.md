# GreenLink — Pilot Quote (1 Club)
**Date:** 10 Feb 2026  
**Prepared for:** <Club Name>  
**Prepared by:** GreenLink

## Summary (What you get)
GreenLink combines **tee sheet operations**, **admin booking management**, **dashboards**, and **daily accounting automation** so the club can run bookings efficiently and post clean journals into **Sage 50 Pastel Partner** with minimal effort.

Key outcomes:
- **Fewer disputes:** HNA-linked handicap alignment and rules checks reduce competition/handicap disputes.
- **Less admin time:** manage bookings, cancellations, check-ins, paid/completed, and reporting in one place.
- **Finance automation:** one click per day generates a **balanced VAT journal** and **imports into Pastel automatically**.
- **Custom fit:** configured to your club’s unique workflows, pricing, and Pastel GL mappings/layout.

## Included features (Pilot scope)
### Operations
- Tee sheet + booking flow (members/visitors)
- Admin booking tools (cancel, check-in, mark paid/completed, audit trail)
- Dashboards (e.g., booked vs paid performance)

### Accounting automation (Sage 50 Pastel Partner)
- One-click **Export to Sage**
- Pastel-ready **journal import CSV** in the club’s exact layout (from their sample export)
- Uses club-specific mappings (no hardcoded accounts): revenue GLs, debit GLs per payment method, VAT control + tax type
- Local desktop automation imports the file into Pastel (Process → Journals → Import)
- Stores export/audit/result files for reconciliation

### HNA integration (included)
- **Handicap alignment:** keeps handicap info aligned with HNA to reduce disputes
- **Open round on check-in:** opens rounds on check-in to align with HNA/competition rules
- **Rules validation + audit trail:** logs validations/actions to reduce disputes and improve compliance

## Optional add-on (separate)
### Online payments portal (optional)
If required, GreenLink can enable an online payments portal and reconciliation flow.

- **Add-on setup (once-off): R15,000**  
- **Add-on monthly: R3,000 / month**  
- **Pilot discount (if signed with the pilot): R10,000 setup** (R5,000 discount)

> Payment gateway/bank fees (MDR / per-transaction fees) are charged by the payment provider and are not GreenLink fees.

## Pricing options (choose one)
### Option A — Month-to-month pilot
- **Setup (once-off): R40,000**
- **Monthly subscription: R12,500 / month**
- Minimum term: **3 months**

### Option B — Contract pilot (best value)
- **Setup (once-off): R30,000**
- **Monthly subscription: R9,500 / month**
- Minimum term: **6 months**

**Discount logic (simple):** Option B monthly is **24% lower** than Option A (R9,500 vs R12,500), and setup is **25% lower** (R30,000 vs R40,000) in exchange for the 6-month commitment.

## Implementation plan (typical)
- **Week 1:** club configuration + tee sheet/admin workflows + dashboards
- **Week 2:** Pastel layout match + GL/VAT mappings + automated import bot setup + go-live

## Client requirements
- Provide a Pastel **sample export/layout** for the journal import format and confirm the target journal (General Journal).
- Provide club-specific **GL accounts** (revenue, debit/settlement, VAT control) and VAT/tax type rules.
- Provide a Windows PC where Pastel is installed and available for automated imports (company open during import window).

## Cost comparison (illustrative)
Publicly advertised tee sheet software pricing varies widely and can be **USD $99–$399+ per month** (often excluding local accounting automation and HNA compliance workflows). See `sales/COMPETITOR_PRICE_NOTES_2026-02-10.md`.

## Acceptance criteria (pilot success)
- Export to Sage produces a Pastel-importable CSV that imports without manual edits.
- Pastel import is automated (desktop automation) and returns success/failure with an audit trail.
- HNA alignment + check-in round-open flow demonstrated on test players (subject to HNA access and rules agreed).
